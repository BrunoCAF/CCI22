# Determination of Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

This project's goal is to study the methods of eigenvalues and eigenvectors determination, such as the power (and inverse power) methods, the Jacobi method for symmetric matrices, and the QR decomposition algorithm. 

Each methods limits and advantages are explored through experiments tailored for such purpose. For example, the impact of using Givens rotations, Householder reflexions or Gram-Schmidt procedure on numerical precision during QR decomposition.
