# Floating Point Arithmetics, Vectorized Operations, and Time Measurements in Algorithms

This project is intended for studying the limits and characteristics of floating point arithmetics and computations, and how they impact on the precision of numerical calculations. 

Another goal of this project is to explore the power of vectorized operations to render some algorithms faster and more efficient. Related to this goal is the analysis of the time taken for some calculations to be executed and the presence of noise in such measurements.
