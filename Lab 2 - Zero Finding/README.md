# Finding Zeros of Functions and solving equations numerically

This project is intended for studying the main methods for finding zeros of functions, such as Bissection, Fixed Point, Newton-Raphson and Secant methods. Those methods allow us in to solve some nonlinear equations in general, and may even be applied to optimization routines.
