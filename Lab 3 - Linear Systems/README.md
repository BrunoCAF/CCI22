# Methods for solving Linear Systems

This project aims to explore some of the several methods for solving linear systems and to understand their pros and cons. The methods are organized in two categories, namely the direct methods (Gaussian Elimination, LU decomposition), and the Iterative Methods, such as Gauss-Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel.
