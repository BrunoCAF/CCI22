# A Survey on Multi-DImensional Numerical Integration methods and approaches

This is my final exam project for the CCI-22: Numerical Calculus course at ITA. 
I picked the subject of multi-dimensional integration methods, which weren't covered in the course, as a way to complement my knowledge on this subject. As opposed to other subjects, integration is one of the few subjects for which we couldn't find easy generalizations from the 1D context to the multi-dimensional one. 

The survey then covers mainly two approaches: the iterated integration approach, which basically rephrases the problem of calculating a multi-dimensional integral as an iteration of 1D integrals; and the stochastic or Monte Carlo approach, which consists on sampling the function throughout the integration region and applying probabilistic theorems to find good estimations to the actual integral. 

A brief discussion on polynomial methods (Gaussian quadratures) is included in the first part, though I don't dive further into that matter. I also mention Bayesian Quadrature as an alternative approach inside the stochastic methods ecosystem, which may be the subject of a future work.
