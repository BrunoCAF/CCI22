# Numerical Integration: One and Multi-Dimensional methods

This is a really special project, aimed at exploring numerical integration methods and their characteristics (error reduction vs. complexity), in a first moment restricted to the 1D case. That includes Trapezoidal's Rule, Simpson's Rules and Adaptative Quadrature methods.  

Furthermore, a thorough survey on multi-dimensional integration methods is carried out, featuring my first Monte Carlo experiments.
