# Curve Fitting, Least Squares Method, Linear Regression

This project studies the techniques for fitting curves to data point, as well as the theoretical nuances of the Least Squares Method, its implementation and complexity. Such methods are then applied to practical problems to determine unknown coefficients in experimental settings.
