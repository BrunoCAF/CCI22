# Numerical Integration of Ordinary Differential Equations

This project deals with the numerical methods for solving ODEs, a main problem for several fields of science and engineering. 

The project was divided in two parts: the first one deals with the so called Simple Step methods, such as Euler, Heun and Runge-Kutta methods, all of which are applied to the resolution of Initial Value Problems only. 

The second part deals with Multiple Step methods, the Prevision-Correction methods, and also explores the solution of Contour Value Problems. 

As a special problem explored in this work, for which the numerical methods were implemented, we studied the solution of a generalized Euler ODE, and compared the behavior of numerical solutions generated by different methods.
