# Interpolation Methods

This project explores the problem of interpolating functions and compares the various different methods available for this purpose, by their capability of reducing interpolation errors for different kinds of functions. 

The experiment is focused on polynomial interpolation methods, such as Newton's Divided Differences method, exploring also the use of Chebyshev nodes and Bernstein polynomials. A second part of the work explores the use of spline functions.
